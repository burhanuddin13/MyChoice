            Honestly, many factors go into a person's physical appearance. I
            wouldn't say that I am unaffected by their physical appearance.
            Everyone wants a good-looking partner. But I do not have a
            definitive list of things I consider beautiful. Beauty is
            subjective; hence, what others may think beautiful/hot may not be
            for me and vice versa. As long as she is beautiful to me, I don't
            care what others think of her. üòç<br />
