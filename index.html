            Honestly, many factors go into a person's physical appearance. I
            wouldn't say that I am unaffected by their physical appearance.
            Everyone wants a good-looking partner. But I do not have a
            definitive list of things I consider beautiful. Beauty is
            subjective; hence, what others may think beautiful/hot may not be
            for me and vice versa. As long as she is beautiful to me, I don't
            care what others think of her. üòç

            Some factors that come to mind include height, weight, hair colour,
            eye colour, etc. A lot of different combinations are possible with
            all of these and in the end, it's up to the individual to how well
            they carry themselves. The girl can be shorter than me (cute ‚ò∫Ô∏è) or
            taller than me (I'll be the cute one then üòä). She could be chubby
            &lt;not obese&gt; or thin or just in between. She can have long hair
            or short hair. All of this individually does not matter; most of it
            is perishable. What I am interested in is if she is obsessed with
            her looks or if she is just natural and happy. As long as she is
            happy and confident, there's no issue.

            In conclusion, I feel that as long as you feel a connection, a lot
            of the physical attributes just do not pose any relevance. They may
            play a role initially but after a while, it's on a backseat.
